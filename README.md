Creation of an application to practice React Native. Best practices everywhere. :smile::star2:

## Notes 
React Component - Four Parts
1. Import libraries we need to create a Component.
2. Create a Component - A function that returns some "JSX".
3. Create a StyleSheet to style our Component.
4. Export the Component so we can use it elsewhere in our project.
* (Component files create and export exactly one React Component)

## Some Basic Elements
* Text: Show some text to the user. Any text placed outside of a Text will result in error.
* View: General purpose element used for grouping other elements or styling.
* Image: Show an image.
* Button: Show a Button that the user can press. Give us some feedback wherever the user pressed it.

## Rules of JSX
* We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML.
* We configure different JSX elements using props.
* We can refer to JS variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces.
* We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then show that variable inside of a JSX block.
